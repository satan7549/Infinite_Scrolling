# Infinite Scrolling Contact List App

This is a responsive infinite scrolling contact list app built using React. It allows authenticated users to view a list of contacts with their photos. The app implements fake login functionality, and the main list UI can only be accessed by logged-in users.

6. The list is designed to be responsive and should look correct on various screen sizes.
7. Each contact in the list displays their name and profile picture.
