# Infinite Scrolling Contact List App

This is a responsive infinite scrolling contact list app built using React. It allows authenticated users to view a list of contacts with their photos. The app implements fake login functionality, and the main list UI can only be accessed by logged-in users.

## Usage

3. After successful login, you will be redirected to the main contact list page ("/home").

5. As you scroll to the end of the page, the app will show a loading feedback and load more contacts after a 1-second delay.
6. The list is designed to be responsive and should look correct on various screen sizes.
7. Each contact in the list displays their name and profile picture.
